# pycommflag
A commercial flagging utility written in Python.

This utility uses image, audio, video, and machine learning techniques to
identify ("flag") segments of a video as being one of several categories:
'content'(aka 'show'), 'commercial' (aka 'advertizing'), 'credits', etc.

This utility can be run directly, or can be integrated into other
applications as a python module.
